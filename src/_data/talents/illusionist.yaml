    range: 30 feet
    duration: 1 hour, until the clone falls to 0 health, or until you decide to end it
  effect: |
    You conjure an illusion that appears as an exact clone of yourself. Your clone apepars at the target point, and is a [[Minion]] creature that you control. Your clone has all the same stats as you, except its maximum Health is 1. Since your clone is an intangible illusion, it cannot physically interact with the world, but it can still be hurt by attacks. Your clone cannot use any powers except for basic powers that don't affect the world, such as {Stride}.

    You have a telepathic link with your clone that lets you communicate instantly and share each others' senses: you can see through each others' eyes and feel everything the other feels. Your clone is perfectly loyal to you and obeys all your commands.

    Your clone has duplicates of all your equipment. However, duplicated magic items lose their magic, and all duplicated equipment fades a few seconds after it is no longer touching your clone.

    ### Invisible Condition

    If you are invisible, you cannot be seen at all. This is enough to completely hide you from anyone who is not actively searching for you.

Phantom Spell:
  tier: Veteran
  type: Free
  brief: You reform your spell as a phantasm within a target's mind
  tags:
    trigger: You cast a spell
    range: 120 feet
  effect: |
    The triggering spell becomes a [[Phantasm]] effect, as you conjure an illusion of the effect inside your target's mind. The spell does not affect any creatures or objects other than your target.

    *For example, if you cast {Major Image} with Phantom Spell, then only your target would be able to perceive the illusion. If you cast {Invoke Blast} with Phantom Spell, then only your target would see the effect or take damage.*

Swap with Clone:
  tier: Veteran
  type: 1-Action
  brief: You reveal that you were actually an illusory clone all along
  traits: [Retroactive]
  tags:
    prerequisites: Illusory Clone
  effect: |
    You and a clone actually swapped places in the past, so you're really somewhere else! Cast {Illusory Clone} now, and declare how long ago in the past that you actually cast the spell, as well as what your true self has been doing the whole time. You cannot contradict established events, and your true self cannot have taken any actions that rely on a die roll to succeed.

    If you add +2 Mana to the cast of Illusory Clone, you can use this power as a {% icon Reaction %} power that triggers when you are targeted by any power. This powers targets your clone instead.

Alter Illusion:
  tier: Master
  type: Free
  brief: You alter an existing illusion to show something completely different
  traits: [Concentrate]
  tags:
    range: 120 feet
    requirements: Your target is affected by an ongoing [[Illusion]] spell
  effect: |
    You modify the target illusion to show something different. You can modify the illusion in a smooth way so that it appears to animate naturally. If the illusion covers an area, you can move the area up to 30 feet.

    Optionally, as you alter the illusion, you can have it briefly become real for a fraction of a second. This generally has no permanent effect on the world, but an illusory flame could start a fire, or an illusory giant could shake the ground as it steps. To use this effect to deal damage, use the **Painful Illusion** power.

    *For example, if you are disguised by an {Illusory Disguise}, you could alter the disguise to make you look like a different creature. Alternatively, if an enemy cast {Static Image} to create a stone wall, you could alter the wall to have an opening for you to see or walk through.*

    *As another example, if you cast {Static Image} or {Major Image} to create an illusory person, you could animate the person to appear to walk naturally, speak, and so on. You could even have this person run up and punch someone, using **Painful Illusion** on the target of the not-so-illusory punch.*

#     You create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the target. Only the spell's target can see the killer, though you can see the vague shape of the illusion as it races forth to attack. The effect of the killer is based on the outcome of the target's Will save.

Whenever you cast a spell, you can cause the spell effect to originate from either yourself or the image. Because the image is an illusion, it isn't a creature and can't benefit from spells. The image has the same AC and saves as you. If it is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends.
