    * The effect of the chosen spell vaguely matches the event you prophesied

    You cast the chosen spell as part of this power. The chosen spell doesn't take effect as normal, but instead takes effect when you use **Observe Prophecy**.

Then you could use **Observe Prophecy** any time you are surrounded by darkness, whether by literal physical darkness or by metaphorical forces of darkness. Your chosen spell might be {Light} or {Daylight}.*

    *As another example, you might prophesy "All creatures who attempt to harm the righteous hero will be slain!" Then you could use **Observe Prophecy** any time a righteous hero or adventurer is attacked. Your chosen spell might be {Harm} or {Invoke Blast}.*
