  brief: You can never truly be defeated, as you always find a way back
  effect: |
    You cannot be permanently killed, jailed, disabled, or otherwise prevented from acting freely. Whenever you are seemingly killed or disabled, after 1 week or so, the GM should introduce some kind of plot contrivance to let you rejoin the action.

Never Tell Me the Odds:
  tier: Ribbon
  type: Passive
  brief: You ignore the normal odds and substitute your own
  effect: |
    Whenever you perform an entirely luck-based activity with two possible outcomes, you can choose to ignore the normal odds and instead make it a 50-50 chance either way. If the original chance of the good outcome was much less than 50%, then the GM should add narrative consequences to the good outcome proportional to how unlikely it was.

    *For example, if you play the lottery, you could choose to have a 50% chance of winning. Since winning the lottery was extremely unlikely, the GM should add severe consequences - maybe a thieves' guild targets you for your newfound riches, or the local lord tries to throw you in jail and take your winnings.*

    *As another example, if you sail a ship along a random path through dangerous waters, you could choose to have a 50% chance of making it through successfully. Since surviving the trip intact was moderately unlikely, the GM should add moderate consequences - maybe your passing aggravated a nearby sea serpent, or maybe you're now hopelessly lost.*

Unreadable:
  tier: Ribbon
  type: Passive
  brief: You can lie without any way to prove you aren't telling the truth
