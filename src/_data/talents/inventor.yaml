    You craft a small magic device that outputs a stream of elemental energy. Choose the engine's element to be one of [[Cold]], [[Electricity]], [[Fire]], [[Sonic]], or [[Toxic]]. The engine continually emits small jet of that element. You can set up the engine to perform a minor utility effect related to its element.

    When you use this power, or with the {Interact} power afterwards, you can attach the engine to a weapon you touch. Strikes with that weapon deal an extra 1d6 damage of the chosen trait. A weapon can only have one engine attached to it at a time.
  aside: |
    ### Using Magitech Engines

    You can configure your magitech engines to output anything related to their element. This makes the engines incredibly versatile parts, useful for any construction project. Be creative!

    As always, the GM has the final say as to whether any attempt is reasonable. The GM may ask you to make an Intellect+Crafting roll to determine if a more difficult use of the engines works out.

    #### Examples

    You can aim a jet at an enemy you can reach to deal 1 damage to that enemy. You can set up a [[Cold]] engine inside of an airtight box to create a portable freezer. You can use an [[Electricity]] engine to power electrical devices, or to fill a metal object with static electricity. You can attach a pair of [[Fire]] engines to the back of a cart to propel it forward like a rocket. You can set up a [[Sonic]] engine to play loud noises you choose, like a powerful speaker.
