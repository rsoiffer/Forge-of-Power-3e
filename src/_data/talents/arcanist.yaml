  traits: [Cantrip, Spell]
  tags:
    cost: 0 Mana
    range: 120 feet
    trigger: Your target casts a spell
  effect: |

Death Ward:
  tier: Novice
  type: 1-Action
  brief: You ward your ally against death with a last-ditch shield
  traits: [Spell]
  tags:

Glyph:
  tier: Novice
  type: 1-Action
  brief: You carve a magical glyph that contains another spell
  traits: [Ritual, Spell]
  tags:
    cost: 2 Mana
    materials: 1 gp of expensive chalk
    target: A flat surface you can reach
    duration: 1 year, until the glyph triggers, or until the glyph is destroyed
  effect: |
    You inscribe a small magical glyph onto your target. The glyph does nothing until it triggers. When the glyph triggers, the **Explosive Runes** effect activates.

    You choose the conditions that trigger the glyph. For example, you could choose for the glyph to trigger when any creature touches or stands on the surface, when an object covering the glyph is removed, or when a creature reads the glyph. You can also specify more complex conditions, such as only triggering when a creature fails to speak a particular password. If the glyph is damaged, it triggers immediately. If two glyphs are in the same 5-foot space for 1 hour, their magic interferes and both trigger. If the glyph is moved more than 5 feet, it becomes unable to trigger for 1 minute.

    Optionally, you can store a different effect in the glyph instead of **Explosive Runes**. When you cast this spell, also cast another spell of your choice. This other spell doesn't take effect as normal, but is instead stored inside the glyph. This other spell takes effect when the glyph triggers. You must specify all the parameters of the spell (including its target, any heightening, and so on) when you store it in the glyph.

    Heightened (per +1 Mana)

Stabilized Glyph:
  tier: Veteran
  type: Passive
  brief: Your glyphs are stable and can apply spells multiple times
  tags:
    prerequisites: Glyph
  effect: |
    When a glyph created by your {Glyph} spell triggers, you can choose for the glyph to be only temporarily disabled instead of permanently destroyed. Any Novice Arcanist can manually reset a disabled glyph, which lets the glyph trigger again in the future. If the glyph contains **Explosive Runes** or a spell of cost 0, the glyph automatically resets after 1 hour.

    Manually resetting a glyph requires 1 minute of work. If the glyph contains a spell of cost 1 or higher, this work consumes an amount of expensive chalk worth 1 gp times the Mana cost of the spell stored in the glyph.

    The wall is physically solid and is weightless. Each panel has 10 Health and 100 [[Anything]] Shield. You choose whether the wall is free-floating or whether it rests on a solid surface.

    area: 10-foot burst
    duration: 1 hour
  effect: |
    You conjure an antimagic field that fills the spell's area. Creatures within the field cannot cast spells, and new spells cannot target anything within the field. Any existing spell affecting a target within the field is temporarily suppressed on that target. (While suppressed, the spell has no effect on the target, but its duration still counts down.)

    *Antimagic Field does not suppress itself. That would just be silly.*

    #### Heightened

    For each +1 Mana, the radius of the burst doubles.

  traits: [Divination, Ritual, Spell]
  tags:
    cost: 2 Mana
    area: 30-foot burst
    duration: 10 minutes
  effect: |
    Whenever anyone in this spell's area knowingly speaks a lie, the spell sends you a ping. This power doesn't detect half-truths or lies by omission. When you cast **Zone of Truth**, you choose whether the ping is perceptible to only you or to everyone nearby.
