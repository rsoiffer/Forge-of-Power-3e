This page will explain the game rules.

Summary:
* Attributes: Agility, Strength, Finesse, Instinct, Presence, Knowledge
* Rolls are d20 + attribute vs. DC, either success or failure
* Advantage / disadvantage as 5e
* Intiative and turns as 5e

Notes:
* Some powers have a number of casts/rest - this replaces mana and encounter/daily powers
* The **controlled** condition means you choose another creature's actions
* Saves are standardized - always half initial damage, no other effect
* Crits are standardized - attacks crit on a nat 20 for double damage
* Power stat - Pd6 means roll a number of d6 equal to your Power stat
* Some power descriptions include lines like "{% icon 1-Action %}: Effect", meaning you can use that inner power while the outer power lasts
* Durations listed as "up to X" means you can end it early
* Durations listed as "brief" mean until the end of your next turn
